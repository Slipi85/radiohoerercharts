This show plays from the bottom (played 20) to the first place.<br>
After that, the votes will be deleted again and updates the chart list.<br>
ie new artists may be added or older titles are hidden, etc.<br><br>
	We, the entire Radio-Team wish you a lot of fun and keep your fingers crossed for your track.',
